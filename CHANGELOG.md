# Changelog

All notable changes to deCDN will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
SemVer applies once the first tag (`v0.1.0`) is cut.

## Conventions

- Entries group by **subsystem** inside each release (runtime, cache, gossip,
  config, CLI, …) so operators can scan for what affects them.
- **Wire-breaking** changes (ALPN bump, message-layout change per ADR 013)
  are called out explicitly — operators cannot hot-upgrade across them.
- **Config-breaking** changes name the field (rename, new required field,
  default shift).
- Security advisories cite the `RUSTSEC-YYYY-NNNN` id.
- Commit prefixes follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

## [Unreleased]

Pre-release development — no versioned tag yet. Entries below track state
since project inception and will roll into the first tagged release.

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **CLI** Split into two binaries (#421). The daemon is now
  `decdn-node` (single subcommand: `decdn-node run [--config <path>]`);
  `decdn run` no longer exists. The user CLI is `decdn` and gains
  `node {peers,health,announce,drain,evict,reload}`, `key-gen`,
  `config {init,validate}`, `probe` — all moved from the old fused
  binary, no behaviour changes. Container image entrypoint becomes
  `decdn-node`. Release archives ship two tarballs per target:
  `decdn-node-${VERSION}-${TARGET}.tar.gz` (operators) and
  `decdn-${VERSION}-${TARGET}.tar.gz` (publishers). See
  [`adr/appendix-binaries.md`](adr/appendix-binaries.md).

### Added

#### Node runtime & wire protocol

- iroh QUIC endpoint bring-up with protocol router (#213).
- `cdn/probe/v1` ALPN with ADR-013 varint framing and `ProbeMessage`
  request/response (#225).
- Compile-time guardrail on `MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE = 16 MiB` per ADR 013 (#287).

#### Cache

- Cache engine wrapping `iroh-blobs` with pull-through on cache miss (#232).
- HTTP origin adapter with connect / response-headers / chunk-idle timeouts.
- Filesystem origin adapter using a git-style sharded layout
  (`{base}/{hex[0..2]}/{hex}`).
- Origin pull-through retry policy with exponential backoff and jitter
  (#285). Configurable via `[cache.origin_retry]` (`max_retries`,
  `initial_backoff_ms`, `max_backoff_ms`, `jitter_ratio`); set once at
  startup, changes require a restart. **Behaviour change:** *enabled by
  default* — cache misses now retry transient HTTP (5xx/408/429/timeouts)
  and filesystem (Interrupted/TimedOut/ResourceBusy/WouldBlock) failures
  up to 3 times with 100ms…10s exponential backoff. Operators relying
  on first-attempt failure semantics must set
  `cache.origin_retry.max_retries = 0`. The active policy is logged at
  startup on the `cache engine ready` line. Two
  `decdn_cache_*_total` Prometheus counters track per-fetch volume
  (`origin_fetches_total`) and terminal exhaustion of the retry budget
  (`origin_retry_exhausted_total`); operators alert on the rate ratio.
  The `Origin` trait surface changed to return
  `Result<OriginFetch, OriginPullError>`; downstream `Origin` impls (if
  any out-of-tree) must be updated.

#### Gossip

- `NodeAnnounce` publish/subscribe over `iroh-gossip` with an in-memory
  peer table (#231).
- Topics: `cdn/global/v1` and `cdn/region/{code}/v1`.
- Validation of signature, timestamp skew, region, and `popular_hashes`
  length/dedup.

#### Config

- Three-layer resolution: CLI flag > TOML file > built-in default.
- `${VAR}` and `~` expansion in TOML fields (#226).
- EIP-55 checksum validation for contract addresses (#227).
- `max_blob_size_mb < cache_size_mb` enforced at startup (#256).
- `rate_per_mb > 0` enforced (#251).
- `eth_keystore` readability verified at startup (#259).
- `identity.region` required when `gossip.subscribe_global = true`.

#### CLI

- `decdn-node run` — run the daemon.
- `decdn config init` / `decdn config validate` (#229).
- `decdn key-gen` — Ed25519 node key + Ethereum keystore.
- `decdn probe` — one-shot latency probe over `cdn/probe/v1`.

#### Observability

- Prometheus metrics over loopback HTTP at `observability.metrics_port`
  (ADR 020).
- Optional OTLP span export behind the `otlp` feature flag.
- `pretty` and `json` log formats (`--log-format`).

#### Identity

- Ed25519 node-identity key at `{data_dir}/node.secret`.
- Permissions validated at load: `0600` on the key file,
  non-world-writable parent (#261).

#### Documentation

- 25 Architectural Decision Records (ADRs 000–025) — see `adr/` for the
  full set and `adr/architecture.md` for the living overview.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with build / lint / test commands and pre-commit setup.

### Security

- `rustls-webpki` → 0.103.12 (RUSTSEC-2026-0098, RUSTSEC-2026-0099) (#253).
- `rustls-webpki` → 0.103.13 (RUSTSEC-2026-0104: reachable panic in CRL
  parsing) (#286).
