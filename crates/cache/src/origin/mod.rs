//! Origin backends — the source of truth a node falls back to on a cache miss.

//! [`Origin`] is the seam. Three concrete implementations ship today:
//! [`HttpOrigin`] (generic HTTP/S), [`FilesystemOrigin`] (local disk), and
//! [`S3Origin`] (S3-compatible object stores: AWS S3, R2, B2, `MinIO`).

/// retrying (HTTP 4xx other than 404, encoding/cap breaches, permission
/// denied). The cache engine drives the retry loop in
/// [`crate::retry::retry_fetch`] off this distinction. `NotFound` is *not*
/// an error — adapters return [`OriginFetch::NotFound`].
