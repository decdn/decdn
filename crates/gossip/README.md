# decdn-gossip

Part of [deCDN](https://github.com/decdn/decdn) — a decentralized CDN where nodes cache and serve BLAKE3-addressed blobs over [iroh](https://iroh.computer) QUIC, and clients pay per megabyte in USDC over off-chain payment channels.

> **Status: early implementation.** deCDN is pre-launch — no network is deployed. Wire formats, APIs and on-chain interfaces change without compatibility shims.

Node metadata broadcast over [`iroh-gossip`](https://docs.rs/iroh-gossip): `NodeAnnounce`
pub/sub, the peer table it feeds, and envelope validation for announcements received from
untrusted peers.
